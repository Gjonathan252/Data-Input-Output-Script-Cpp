# Data-Input-Output-Script-Cpp
Cpp script using &lt;fstream> ifstream and ofstream to read and write data to excel sheet. script

This is a basic script to read and write data to csv file. Data can be read to txt and excel sheet.
This script was writted to be used for me by me to be used at work for quick documentation of documents.

i.e 50,000 data points require to be written as scentence or with value.
data1, data2, data - > data1 = 1, data2 = 2, data3 = 3.
Code can be changed for quick documentation of any data types or data testing.

This code holds no purpose but to be used as reference.
